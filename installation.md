# Installation

If you want to run our application locally, you can navigate to your terminal or command prompt(windows), and run the following command :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matias-io/csi2532-project.git
```

This will download the zip file of the project.

If you are lost as to where it was downloaded, you can run

```bash
# For mac, you must make sure it says bash and not zsh. (if it does say zsh, you can simply type `bash` in the terminal to switch to a bash terminal)

# Because ZSH will not accept the # commented part. 

# Preferably, you should only run `pwd` or `cd` to avoid any comment related errors

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pwd # Mac (bash), Linux(bash), PowerShell 

cd  # For Command prompt on windows

```

Once cloned, you can navigate to the `cd [downloadsâ€™s directory] / [csi2532-project](https://github.com/matias-io/csi2532-project.git)`

```
cd $PWD/csi-2532 (Mac, Bash)
```

From now on, we will assume you are in the [csi2532-project](https://github.com/matias-io/csi2532-project.git) directory.
